 * Leaky Fire-and-Integrate Spike Response Model (SRM) 
 * 
 * This neural model follows the principles of the SRM
 * model as defined in 'Neural Dynamics' book and the
 * model implemented by Alamdari.
 * 
 * This neuron takes not only inputs from an input layer
 * but also accepts horizontal inputs from neurons in
 * the same layer.
 * 
 * Refer to the citations of this project on more information
 * on the neural models implemented in this work.
 * 
 * On regular models, the refactory filter (eta) is used to
 * describe the membrane's refactory period. In this model,
 * we asume the neuron reaches u_r immediately, but remains
 * on refactory period for a specified (t_reset) amount of time.
 * During this time, no spikes can enter, and the neuron resets
 * all kappa lists to be empty so that when the refactory period
 * ends, the neuron is back to u_rest.
