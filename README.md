World Representation with Spiking Neural Networks
=================================================

This repository contains the code used for the paper that it is to come out sometime soon after february 1st.

Here, I utilize Spiking Neural Networks that have been modified from several papers on the topic, to build a self-organizing world representation system. This system uses a shallow networks and uses delays to follow a more biological accurate model. This system will build a path where a robot can maneuver through without previous experience and "remember" its placement.
